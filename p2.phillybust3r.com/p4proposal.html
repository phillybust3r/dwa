		<title>P4 Proposal</title>
	</head>
	<body>
	<p>My plan for P4 is to create a technology web based article similar to engadget or digital trends.
	The user can create an account, where the user can subscribe to an author, topic of interest, make comments. There will be a default splash page where all the general articles are found. Once the user logs in their account, they can see all the articles they are subscribe to, or maybe to articles that may be suggested to them of interest.
	</p>
	
	<p>Examples:</p>
	
	<a href="http://www.droid-life.com/"> DROID LIFE</a>
	<br>
	<a href="http://www.engadget.com/?m=false"> ENGADGET</a>
	<br>
	<a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/">DIGITAL TRENDS</a>
