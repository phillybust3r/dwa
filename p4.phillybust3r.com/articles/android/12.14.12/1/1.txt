Last week, during a quest to find the best Nexus 4 case, I found an option from one of our favorite case companies, Rearth. Their Ringke SLIM for the Nexus 4 was available on Amazon for $9.99 in a variety of colors, so naturally, I jumped on it. Unfortunately, the original version of the SLIM had some fit issues near the volume rocker, making it a bit uncomfortable to use. But thankfully, Rearth didn’t waste time in releasing a revised version with optimal fit. This new version showed up in a set on my doorstep yesterday, so let’s talk about it.
